# The-Mill

A Computer Graphics project made using Blender and Unity. The goal of the project is to create a game with 3 separate stages (levels). In this game, the player is trapped inside a mill in a dark forest and tries to escape it by overcoming obstacles and searching for the keys to your freedom. Each of the levels presents one of the segments of the big windmill, and each with it's own unique set of challenges. As the player progresses forward in the game, he will experience the dark secrets that lie within... The Mill.
